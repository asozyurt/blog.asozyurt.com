# Simple Blog Engine With .Net Core (Static Theme) 

This is a file-based, easy to customize and fast Asp.Net Core blog engine. Over the original repository, I made some visual and additional changes on it.

Result is :

![Blog screenshot 1](http://blog.asozyurt.com/img/blog_screenshot.jpg)

You could knock this up yourself in an hour of course but the advantages of using this blog engine are the extra features you get for free :

* Contact page
* Tag system
* Recent posts sidebar
* Open graph meta tags
* Optional built-in third party support for :
  * Disqus comments
  * AddThis for sharing blog posts
  * Google Analytics
  * Google Recaptcha on the contact page
* View hook points for customisation
* Basic theme support
* Non-destructive updates to engine version
* Code syntax highlighting built in
* And the obvious ASP.NET Core benefits :
  * SEO friendly URLs
  * Responsive design
  * Cross platform deployment

[My blog](http://www.garethelms.org) uses it and it's much faster now I've switched from Wordpress.

# Interested? How to get started

Grab the repo from [Github](https://github.com/GarethElms/simple-blog-engine-for-asp-net-core) and open it up in Visual Studio or VS Code. It'll run straight out of the box but you'll want to change some settings before you go live. It's a three step process :

## Step 1 of 3 : siteSettings.json

Copy `\Settings\System\siteSettings.json` into `\Settings\Custom\siteSettings.json`. In the copied file fill in the blanks so it looks something like this :

```javascript
{
  "SiteSettings": {
    "owner": "Joe Blogs",
    "description": "Joe Blogs from Manchester UK talks about .NET, ASP.NET and whatever else tickles his fancy.",
    "siteName": "joeblogs.org",
    "siteURL": "www.joeblogs.org",
    "theme": {
      "themeName": "default",
      "headerImage": "",
      "shareImage": "{theme}/img/share-image.jpg"
    },
    "debugMode": {
      "showViewHooks": "false"
    },
    "metaData": {
      "locale":  "en_GB",
      "twitterUserName": "joe_blogs",
      "pageTitlePrefix": "",
      "pageTitleSuffix": " - www.joeblogs.org"
    }
  }
}
```

I'll explain what all the settings mean at the end of this readme.

## Step 2 of 3 : Create a blog post

Create a cshtml file in `\Views\_blogSource` and write your blog post content in HTML. Don't include the blog post title here (see step 3 below). You can name the cshtml file however you wish and use directories to organise them to your liking.

Alternatively you can use an online HTML editor to write your post and then paste the HTML into the view. For example : https://html-online.com/editor/.

Any images you need can be added to the `wwwroot\img` folder. If you do add images make sure to use the bootstrap class `img-fluid` otherwise they won't resize and may also exceed the container boundary.

`<img class="img-fluid" src="...`

You may notice the default views in the view folder, you can delete these if you want (but don't delete `_template-copy-me.cshtml` it's handy) :

![Default views](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/default-views.jpg)

If you're writing about code and want to use the built-in code syntax highlighting then use HTML like this :

``` html
<div class="code-container">
  <pre><code class="javascript">{
  var message = "This is my javacsript";
}</code></pre>
</div>
```

See the [highlight.js docs](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo) for different code clases eg; html, csharp etc... 

## Step 3 of 3 : Tell the engine about your blog post

Once you've written your blog post you need to tell the engine about it. We just edit a settings file for that.

Copy `\Settings\System\blogPosts.json` into `\Settings\Custom\blogPosts.json` and edit the file.
You'll notice a "blogs" array in the JSON. Each object in the array represents a blog post.
The array initially contains the default blog posts that demonstrate the engine. Delete those, leaving just an empty blogs array like this :

``` javacsript
{
  "blogsPerPage":3,
  "NumberOfRecentBlogPostsToShowInSidebar": 5,
  "blogs":[]
}
```

Now add an object for your new blog post. Make sure that the "view" property is set to the name of the view you created for the blog post. You can add easily tags too :
  
``` javascript
{
  "blogsPerPage":3,
  "NumberOfRecentBlogPostsToShowInSidebar": 5,
  "blogs":[{
   "published":true,
	"title":"My First Blog Post",
	"description": "This description is displayed on the <a href="/blog/all">/blog/all</a> page.",
	"date":{
	  "year":"2017",
	  "month":"11",
	  "day":"4",
	  "display":"Nov 4th, 2017"
	}, 
	"author":"Your Name",
	"slug":"my-first-blog-post",
	"view":"myFirstBlogPost.cshtml",
	"tags":["test", "blog"]
  }
    /* ,{...} &quot;blogs&quot; is an array. Future blog posts go here too */
  ]
}
```

In the future I may add an alternative method of adding blog post settings so that it's more manageable when there are lots of posts. For now it's fine.

You're done, that's a basic blog ready for deployment. Just repeat the process for each new blog post. There are lots of extra features though so let's go through them.

## Customisation

If you look in `\Views\Shared\EmptyCustomViews` you'll see lots of empty views. These are all the hook points where you can insert your own HTML :

![Empty views](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/hook-points.jpg)

The best way to visualise where these hook points are is to edit `\Settings\Custom\siteSettings.json` and set `debugMode.showViewHooks = "true"`. This triggers a box to display where each hook point sits in the layout.
  
![Debug mode](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/debug-mode.jpg)

You won't want to keep this debug mode active for very long as it looks like this :

![Hook points enabled](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/hook-points-enabled.jpg)

Find the view hook you need and copy it from `\Views\Shared\EmptyCustomViews` into `\Views\Custom`. Don't edit anything in `\Views\Shared\EmptyCustomViews` otherwise it'll be overwritten when you update the engine. Always copy custom views from `\Views\Shared\EmptyCustomViews`> in this way before you edit them. *Tip:* You can do this with any view by the way, not just hook points.

This view overriding behaviour is enabled via a simple view locator in `\Utility\CustomViewLocationExpander.cs` :

``` csharp
public class CustomViewLocationExpander : IViewLocationExpander
{
  public IEnumerable<string> ExpandViewLocations(ViewLocationExpanderContext context, IEnumerable<string> viewLocations)
  {
    // {1} is the controller and {0} is the name of the View
    var newViewLocations = new List<String>(viewLocations);
    newViewLocations.Insert(0, "/Views/Shared/EmptyCustomViews/{0}.cshtml"); // First. for a moment.
    newViewLocations.Insert(0, "/Views/Custom/{0}.cshtml"); // Not any more, this is first now.
    return newViewLocations;
  }

```

A good example of using a hook point is to add a mailing list signup form to your sidebar and at the bottom of blog posts. In [my blog](http://www.garethelms.org) I used `_hook_sideBarTop.cshtml` and `_hook_blogPostBeforeComments.cshtml` to add some HTML from Tiny Letter.

![Hook points example](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/hook-point-example.jpg)
  
 ## Themes
 
 The current theme is declared in siteSettings.json
 
 ![Hook points example](http://www.garethelms.org/img/2017/11/current-theme.jpg)
 
The theme name just maps to `\wwwroot\themes\{themName}` so you can add your own resources in an organised folder. You don't have to use a theme, there's nothing stopping you putting your resources wherever you like, but be aware that if you edit the default theme's files you will lose your changes when you upgrade the engine. Make your own theme.

## Settings files

### siteSettings.json

### hosting.json
This is your standard ASP.NET Core hosting.json file. This is useful if you're deploying through a proxy server such as Apache on Ubuntu. Apache needs to know where your web site's service sits

## Working with the settings

The settings files are parsed into POCO objects. If you want to use the settings in your own views you can inject them like this :

``` csharp
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor<AddThisSettings> addThisConfigMonitor
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;BlogPostsSettings&gt; blogPostConfigMonitor
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;DisqusSettings&gt; disqusConfigMonitor
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;EmailSettings&gt; emailConfigMonitor
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;GoogleAnalyticsSettings&gt; googleAnalyticsSettings
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;GoogleRecaptchaSettings&gt; googleRecatchaSettings
@@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsMonitor&lt;SiteSettings&gt; siteSettings
```

Just inject the settings you need. Then to access the settings using do something like `siteSettings.CurrentValue`.

## Startup.cs
Some magic happens in Startup.cs. 

The array of blog posts configuration objects from `blogPosts.settings` are ordered by date and any unpublished blogs removed. The tags are also loaded into an array along with each tag's blog count.

Because the settings files are monitored for changes they are automatically mapped into POCOs when you edit them and there's no need to restart your web server. The settings files are	only parsed at startup and when they are changed. The resulting POCOs are always in memory ready for action.

## What's Next

It depends if people are interested but a vague list of possible future changes are :

* Plugins
* Markdown support
* Admin logon for easier editing of settings and blog posts
* Resource bundling
* Change where blog post settings are stored
